# Learning Intel x64 Assembly
I am using [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-x64-Assembly-Programming-Professional/dp/1484250753) for learning

Also I am using SimpleASM for writing, running and debugging my code

Programs list:

    1. Functions
        - first_program: displaying "hello world"

        - square_and_circle: using functions to calculate areas, perimeters etc.
        - external_functions: using multiple .asm files at once
        - arguments_passing: using registers for passing mutiple parameters
    2. Memory
        - stack_alignment: main stack functionality
        - string_reversing: using stack to reverse a string
    3. NumberOperations
        - integers: basic operations on integers
        - floats: basic operations on floating-point numbers
    4. Other
        - looping: using loops in code
        - jumping: using conditional statements
