# Learning Intel x64 Assembly
I am using [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-x64-Assembly-Programming-Professional/dp/1484250753) for learning

Also I am using SimpleASM for writing, running and debugging my code

Programs list:

	1 - Displaying "Hello world"
	2 - Printing formatted strings/numbers
	3 - Jumping. Comparing two numbers (=, >, <)
	4 - Looping. Calculating sum from 1 to a certain number
	5 - Basic integer operations (sum, division, product etc.)
	6 - Using stack and its operations for reversing a string
	7 - Floating-point numbers, basic operations on them
	8 - Using functions to calculate areas, perimeters etc.
	9 - Using multiple .asm files at once
